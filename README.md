## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone the repo

```bash
npx degit 'txsoura/blog.txsoura.com'
```

2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)
3. Modify the content security policy in `next.config.js` if you want to use
   other analytics provider or a commenting solution other than giscus.
4. Create a medium account and get your public profile url
5. Deploy on Vercel

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

Please note, that if you are using Windows, you may need to run:

```bash
set PWD="$(pwd)"
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit the layout in `app`. With live reloading, the pages auto-updates as you edit them.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - tailwind configuration and stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`app` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

## Post

Every posts you do on your [Medium](https://medium.com/), setted as public, will be fetched and shown on your blog.

## Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Netlify**
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)’s Next.js runtime configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR), `next/images`, etc.

See [Next.js on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime) for suggested configuration values and more details.

**Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.**

1. Add `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`. See [static exports documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration) for more information.
2. Comment out `headers()` from `next.config.js`.
3. Add `unoptimized: true` to the `images` key in `next.config.js`:

   Alternatively, to continue using `next/image`, you can use an alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai. See [image optimization documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) for more details.
4. Run `yarn build`. The generated static content is in the `out` folder.
5. Deploy the `out` folder to your hosting service of choice or run `npx serve out` to view the website locally.

**Note**: Deploying on Github pages require addition modifications to the base path. Please refer to the FAQ for more information.
